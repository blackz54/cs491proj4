compute_Z() - This function takes in an input array and two optional boolean parameters. If the first boolean parameter is set to true, then the input array data is centered based on the mean value for each column. If the second boolean parameter is set to true, then each column in the input data is divided by that column's standard deviation. The resultant array after these operations is returned.
compute_covariance_matrix() - This function takes an input array, Z, as a parameter and returns the result of the calculation of the transpose of Z multiplied by Z.
find_pcs() - This function takes an input array as a parameter which is a covariance matrix. This function computes the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. Then the eigenvalues are sorted in descending order and the eigenvectors are also sorted based on their respective eigenvalues. 
project_data() - This function takes in the Z matrix, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, k amount of principal components, and var a float. This function projects the input data into k dimensions using the most significant eigenvectors.
